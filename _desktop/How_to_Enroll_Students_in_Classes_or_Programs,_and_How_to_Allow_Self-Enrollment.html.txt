<p>At this point in time, as a registrar, you have had a student apply,
you have approved their application, and now the question is: do you
want the student to self-enroll in courses and programs, or do you want
to place them in a course and program? This really depends on what you
would like to do.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Many times, if it’s an individual course, you might let the student
enroll themselves, but if it is for a program, we suggest that you put
them in the program.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Here’s how you would do it: you have gone through the approval
process, and you have someone who is approved. You’re going to go back
to that student and look at their student records. In their student
records, you will see programs, and you can click on this to see all the
different programs that are available.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>You enroll them by hitting “enroll.” This particular student is
already enrolled in two different programs, so that’s fine. You can also
see what courses the student is enrolled in and self-enroll them from
the administrative side by seeing what other courses are available and
hitting “enroll.”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at this from the student perspective. As a student,
when you look at your student records, it shows a lot of information
right off the bat. It gives you a general overview, which we will show
how to set up at a later date.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It shows what programs you are in and where you are in that program.
For example, in an older program, it shows that they have already taken
certain courses and completed them. It also shows other courses that
need to be taken. Students can perform a degree audit by saying they
need to take one more course. They can register right there and go to
the marketplace to see exactly what they need to register in and what to
do next.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>From the student record, they can see all the information about
themselves. It would be recommended that you place them into the
program. How to build a program will be another part, and maybe someone
else can do it.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>So let’s review: you have created the application, students have
applied, you have accepted them, and you have placed them into a
program.</p>

to the software, but the core functioning is largely unchanged. There
also may be some slight difference due to organization-specific
customizations. First recorded April 2024.)
